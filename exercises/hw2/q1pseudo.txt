/* This is my pseudocode for Question 1. */

function wSalCalc(argument1, argument 2){
	 Calculates the weekly salary by multiplying the pay rate per week by week
	 Returns a double
}
end
function hSalCalc(argument1, argument 2){
	 Calculates the hourly wage by taking the argument 2, hours, and subtracting 10 from it.  This 10 is then multiplied by the pay rate, argument 1.  This is later added to the product of 1.5 and the rest of their hours remaining.
	 Returns a double.
}

function cSalCalc(argument1){
	 Calculates the commission by adding 250 to 7.1 * their hours
	 Returns a double
